# Basic-Text-Pre_Processing-Using-NLTK-2

# üß† NLP (Project 2)

This project walks through the complete **Natural Language Processing (NLP) life cycle**, applying a wide range of core NLP techniques using Python. It serves as a hands-on demonstration of how raw text can be transformed, analyzed, and made machine-readable for downstream tasks such as classification or information extraction.

## üìö Topics Covered

The project explores the following NLP techniques:

- ‚úÖ Text Preprocessing
  - Tokenization
  - Lowercasing
  - Stop Words Removal
  - Stemming
  - Lemmatization
- ‚úÖ Feature Extraction
  - Bag of Words (BoW)
  - TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
- ‚úÖ NLP Analysis
  - POS Tagging (Part-of-Speech Tagging)
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
  - Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- `nltk`
- `sklearn`
- `pandas`, `numpy`

## üß™ Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**  
   Load raw text or dataset for processing.

2. **Text Preprocessing**  
   Apply tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization.

3. **Advanced NLP Techniques**  
   - POS tagging for grammatical structure
   - NER to identify entities like names, dates, organizations
   - WSD to resolve ambiguity in word meanings
  
4. **Feature Extraction**  
   Convert textual data to numerical format using:
   - Bag of Words
   - TF-IDF Vectorizer

5. **Visualization**  
   Word frequencies, POS distribution, and other insights.
